After seeing my friend [Ryan English](https://github.com/GrizzlyEnglish) get involved with the Angular repo, he inspired me to contribute to some open source projects myself. Since I have a writing background, I figured the [dotnet/docs](https://github.com/dotnet/docs) repo would be a good place to start.

Most of my PRs were pretty minor, such as an addition to the [where constraint definition](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/30702) or fixing a [bunch of broken XML code blocks](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/30680).

But I was quite happy about my addition of the [F# 5 and! syntax](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/30447) being accepted; it was tricky to get the wording just right and format the method signatures correctly, but the related links on the parent issue were quite helpful!
