This year I mentored a couple sessions for [Code Louisville](https://www.codelouisville.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to training and supporting new developers.

This involved a 2-hr weekly class to aid students with their projects, give demos of various topics in web development, and helping them gain both the hard and soft skills needed to be a successful software developer.
