As an automation engineer @ Humana:
- I developed an Angular + ASP.Net Core app for managing HP SiteScope monitors.
- I trained 3 teammates on usage of Git, frontend JavaScript frameworks, and client-server relationships.
- I created a PowerShell module with 4 cmdlets for automating VMWare resource changes (with unit testing).

As a financial aid counselor @ The Learning House:
* I created a [Vue.js app for data-entry](https://mducharm.github.io/VueCallHelper/), saving 30 minutes every day per counselor.
* I made a [student loan calculator](https://mducharm.github.io/student-loan-calc/) to give estimates of accrued interest for federal student loans.

As a developer:
- I gave a presentation on Vue.js at JSLou in 2019 (~40 people in attendance).
- I love learning new languages and tools, and love teaching what I learn even more.
- I'm addicted to productivity tricks - creating VSCode extensions, using Vim, and discovering little-known features about the tools we use every day.
